# RandomizeFromDB
A small program using Pokemon to practice utilizing items with a local SQL Database and randomizing them from that DB info.<br><br>

Version 2.0 <br>
Improvements from Version 1.0: <br>
- used C# to directly call database and eliminates DDLists
- all events happening within button click through multiple methods

Things to Optimize:<br>
- ensure that once a selection has been chosen it is not chosen until the entire list is exhausted. <br>
- enable cross platform usage and store initial information on a mobile friendly DB<br>
OR <br>
- use "pseudo-saving" and store PokemonDB information within a text file and call it on the mobile.  

<br><br>

The basic functionality of the app works besides being able to exclude repeats.
